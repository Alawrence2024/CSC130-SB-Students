## Important Notes
- **Do not edit or remove other students' entries.** Only add your name below the placeholder.
- **Pull the latest changes before adding your name** to avoid conflicts:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
- If you encounter a merge conflict, carefully resolve it, ensuring all names are preserved, and then commit the resolution:
  ```bash
  git add submissions.txt
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in submissions.txt"
  git push
  ```
